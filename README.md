Cloned from this https://github.com/Trxyebeep/TOMB4

Stuff I did:
* increased max save slots to 100
* mechanical scarab has use count
* little scarabs can climb only 2 clicks instead of 4
* wraith will die almost immediately on totem
* binocular hotkey (Q)
* infinite sprinting (probably should be a setting)
* centered window with black background
* hardcoded d3d values to avoid enum and screen flickering at the beginning (resolution hardcoded to 1600x1200 for now)

Stuff I'm working on:
* my own tomb engine based on this
